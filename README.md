## üéØ What is Red Teaming in AI?

Red teaming in artificial intelligence is a systematic approach to testing AI systems by simulating adversarial scenarios to identify potential vulnerabilities, biases, or harmful behaviors. This methodology helps ensure AI systems are robust, fair, and safe before deployment.

### Key Aspects of AI Red Teaming:
- **Adversarial Testing**: Simulating challenging scenarios to test model robustness
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating unfair biases in AI outputs
- **Safety Evaluation**: Ensuring AI systems don't produce harmful or inappropriate content
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Finding scenarios where models may fail or behave unexpectedly
